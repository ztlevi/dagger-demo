# Dagger demo
## Spring Analogies
Those familiar with Spring may have noticed some parallels between the two frameworks.

Dagger's `@Module` annotation makes the container aware of a class in a very similar fashion as any of Spring's stereotype annotations (for example, `@Service`, `@Controller`â€¦). Likewise, `@Provides` and `@Component` are almost equivalent to Spring's `@Bean` and `@Autowire/@Lookup` respectively.
